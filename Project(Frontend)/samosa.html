            <br><br><br>
          <h3 class="content-title" style="color: rgb(255, 165, 0);">Directions</h3>
          <ol class="directions-list">
            <li>Mix everything very well. Rub the flour inbetween your palms to incorporate the vanaspati well for 3 to 4 minutes. after this step the flour should resemble bread crumbs. press down a handful of this flour in your palm, it should form or hold the shape. it should not crumble meaning vanaspati is well incorporated. Add 4 tablespoon of water and begin to form a dough ball adding more water as needed.</li><br>
            <li>Dough has to be firm, stiff and not sticky. cover and rest for 25 to 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Heat 1tbsp of oil in a pan. next and cumin seeds. when the seeds begins to splutter and add bay leaf, chopped ginger, chopped green chilli. saute for 20 to 30 seconds. optional - you can also add cashews.. and then add cooked and mashed potatoes.</li><br>
            <li>Add spice powders.. mix well 2 to 3 minutes until potatoes blend well with spice powders. finally add chopped coriander leaves. taste test this and adjust salt if needed.</li><br>
            <li>After 30 minutes knead the dough for another 2 to 3 minutes. the dough has to be stiff yet and not soft. oil the counter or rolling board place the ball. roll it to a oval shape even layer. it has to be slightly thick and not to too thin. cut it in the centre to make 2 parts. apply water with your fingers over the straight edge.</li><br>
            <li>Join the edges to make a cone shape like you see in the picture. stick the edges well. stick the edges from inside the cone as well to secure. if you have trouble sticking make a paste of 2tbsp flour and little water. smear little paste to stick the edges.</li><br>
            <li>Fill the cone with potato masala. Press down a bit with a tint spoon.</li><br>
            <li>Stick the edges to seal well. make sure your samosa sealed well. pinch and press down on the edges very well to seal them. this will give you a perfectly standing samosa.</li><br>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil for deep frying. the oil should be moderately hot and not very hot. add a small portion of dough to the oil it has to raise slowly and the oil must not to be bubbling or sizzling a lot. you should see only tiny bubbles. this is right temperature.</li><br>
            <li>Gentle slide as many samosa as you can to the oil. I fry 3 samosa at a time. fry them on a low flame, undisturbed for about 10 to 12 minutes. turn them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden. remove from the oil.</li><br>
            <li>Now ready to serve. Super crispy and tasty samosa ready.</li>
