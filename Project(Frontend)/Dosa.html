          <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>1.5 cups idli rice - 330 grams, (parboiled rice, ukda chawal, sela chawal) or 1.5 cups regular rice</li><br>
            <li>1/2 cup urad dal - 125 grams, husked whole or split black gram</li><br>
            <li>1/4 cup thick poha - 35 grams, flattened rice</li><br>
            <li>husked and split bengal gram</li><br>
            <li>20 fenugreek seeds</li><br>
            <li>3 cup water for soaking urad dal & rice</li><br>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon rock salt</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br><br>
          <h3 class="content-title" style="color: rgb(255, 165, 0);">Directions</h3>
          <ol class="directions-list">
            <li>Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils and keep it for grinding urad dal.Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal. You can even use fresh water while grinding.</li><br>
            <li>Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.</li><br>
            <li>Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. To make the batter, I added 1 cup water. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.</li><br>
            <li>Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency. You can even grind to a smooth batter. Now pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.</li><br>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt. Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.</li><br>
            <li>Lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter and it would have increased in volume.</li><br>
            <li>Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the batter.</li><br>
            <li>Keep the flame to a low, while spreading batter. Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. On a medium flame, cook the dosa.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle some oil on top and edges. Cover with a lid and let it cook. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon. Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp.</li><br>
            <li>When you see the base has become golden and the edges separate from the pan, place a portion of the potato filling on the dosa. You can spread it a bit if you want.</li><br>
            <li>Now fold the dosa and serve.</li>
